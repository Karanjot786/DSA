/**First of all lets understand what is binary search.
 * In this algorithm the array taken as input is pre-sorted in any order. 
 * 1- First of all we compare the search element with the element of the array.If its true then the search is complete.
 * 2-If its not , then if the search element is greater than the middle element then for the next time we will search only in the array starting
 * from the (mid+1) index and ending at the upperbound of the array.Here mid is the index of the middle element
 * 3 - If its less than the middle element then we will search in the array starting at the lowerbound of the array and ending at the index
 * (mid+1). 
 * 4- Thus every time we search in half the array of the previous array.
 * 5- Its time complexity is O(log n) which means that its a very efficient algorithm.
